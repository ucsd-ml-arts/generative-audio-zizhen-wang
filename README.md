# Project 3 Generative Audio

## Abstract

Different types music always have the specific rhythm, melody and instruments. People could recognize these sytles depends on the them but if we use machine learning to generate the new music which it may change the number of instrument, the melody and the rhythm, could we still can recognize them. I will sue GANsynth, MusicVAE and Transformer to change the number of instruments, the melody and the rhythm in different orders to get results

## Model/Data


La companella
This is a piano song which represents classical style and only one instrument.

## Results
- Firstly, I used GANSynth generator to generate new music by 16 random samples of instruments. GANSynth is a new approach to audio synthesis using neural networks to release a playable set of neural synthsizer instruments. The Synth dataset has a lot of intruments samples and qualities like bright or dark.  They use encoder and decoder to generate new instuments into new waveform. The generate custom inerpolation for instruments: [0, 3, 6, 0] and for time :[0, 0.3, 0.6, 1.0]

- The first one is original music and second one is generated music. We will see the form for x-axis is almost same which means the rhythm and melody is almost same. We could also listen from these 2 musics. The interesting thing is the generated music still keep the classic music style and it listens like symphony or drama which have a lot of instruments.

- Secondly, I used Generating Piano Music with Transformer for melody-conditioned piano performance model. Music Transformer is an attention-based neural network that can generate music with improved long-term coherence. For the training data, I both use the original music and generated music by GANSynth to input 16-bar melody models and temperature is 0.5.

First one is generated by original music and second one is generated by generated music by GANSynth. These two we see that they both changed the melody. Since the provided samples are all piano so they both generated output is piano music. However, the first one is more discrete in waveform and the second is more continuous in waveform. After listening these two samples, we found the first one has like more staccato and the second one has more prolonged sound and more bass sound. My assumption is more instruments have more waveforms covered and when it decodes and encodes, the output will be more smooth and continuous.
